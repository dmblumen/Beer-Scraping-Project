A mix of citrusy hops and a touch of malt sweetness and perhaps even a perception of sweetness from the hops (maybe tropical fruit) work to balance this one out, both in flavor and finish.","A unique beer with some very interesting and new hops flavors, though restrained, that work well. The hops character is complex and unique with just enough malt backbone to keep things balanced and a distinct character in the hops selection.",https://beerandbrewing.com/print/VMrCbysAAKCj5SzL/cbb-beer-review/pale-ale-upslope,Pale Ale,Upslope Brewing Company

Notes of roasted coffee beans, with a slight hint of chocolate, dominate the aroma, but Simcoe and Fuggle hops add complexity. The roasted barley complements the bitterness from the Warrior hops.","Rich malty and roast character with very light fruit and some alcohol notes. Sweet chocolate, caramel, and nice coffee notes round out the malt forward nose. Toffee, caramel, butterscotch, moderate sweetness, and no heat.","Bitter chocolate and dry cocoa carry through from the start through the finish. Sweet dark fruit, raisins, and prunes add to the sweetness. Roasted malt character increases in the finish, with nice coffee qualities. Some alcohol warmth in the finish.","Very tasty and enjoyable, but this is an understated imperial stout: a mild example for simple pleasures. Malt sweetness and roast character come together well, and warmth adds nice complexity.

The smooth, soft maltiness of this traditional lager is complemented by a noticeable but restrained hops presence. The beer finishes with a lingering dryness and just a hint of caramel. The word ‘bock’ also means ‘billy goat,’ and images of goats are often used as a symbol of the style.","Spicy, somewhat resinous hops aroma. Malt is less assertive, like lightly toasted bread. A touch of oxidation detracts from the Pils malt character.","Soft, slightly soapy, even thin malt. Light malt is the strongest component. Some oxidized notes. Medium, balanced hop bitterness with a kiss of hop flavor. Harsh bitterness in the finish and a bit of ethanol, too. Clean lager finish.","The hops bitterness dominates the flaccid malt character. The finish is astringent and harsh. This is mostly a mild delivery mechanism for alcohol, but watered down enough not to be dangerous. Easy-drinking and fairly refreshing, but one-dimensional.",https://beerandbrewing.com/print/VLgrDiwAACwA2Kof/cbb-beer-review/boss-toms-golden-bock,Bock,Boulevard Brewing Company Boss Tom’s Golden

Light wheat sweetness. The strong coriander character is sharper and less herbal than is typical.",Nice level of acidity to carbonic bite. Simple flavors of slightly musty coriander and honey wheat sweetness with very little hop flavor. Finish is a bit cloying instead of crisp.,"Not-too-sweet finish makes this an easy-drinking, refreshing wit. Body does not hold up to strong coriander flavor.

Toasted sweet bread, subtle caramel, some butterscotch, earth, piney character, rhubarb? sour cherries? grapes?","If they said this was a raspberry English bitter, it wouldn’t be surprising. Very fruity and tart. Flavors blend between grape notes and citrus with slight grapefruit. Complex fruitiness dances through. Finishes dry with a slight warmth. Rhubarb. Astringent. Smoked cherry. It’s gotta be grape.","Hops are well-selected to favor earthy, spicy over citrus. Fruitiness is fresh and crisp.

Dark cherry fruit notes. Nice and sweet and roasty. Huge dry oak aromatics. Some vanilla sweetness ties things together Roast notes are more like a French-roast coffee bean than roasted malt.","Juicy, chewy, and rich. Huge dark chocolate notes dominate, but they are cut by vanilla sweetness and oak tannins to add a nice complexity. Some background coconut from the barrel but also a nice fruitiness that lends a roundness. The roast isn’t overly bitter, but still prominent.","Great beer! The chocolate complexity combined with everything else that is going on adds up to a great glass. So dense and heavy, light can barely escape its gravitational pull.

Hops are strongly citrus, mostly orange and lemon with some pineapple beneath. Well blended throughout the palate and no rough edges. Nice citrusy hops—tangerine and grapefruit—buoyed by a breath of malt. Good bitterness that lasts into the finish, but the citrus is the main impression. Nice malt sweetness to back the hops. Lots of juicy fruit character—pineapple, orange, lemon—it all comes together and blends but stands out nicely. The finish is equally strong. Great hops flavor that carries through this beer.",A great example of the evolution of the style despite the delicate nose. Smells and tastes very fresh. The malt here is well played and supports the flavor even as it balances the bitterness.
